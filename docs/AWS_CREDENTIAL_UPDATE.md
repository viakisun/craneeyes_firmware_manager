# AWS Credential Update Log

**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Summary

AWS credentials have been successfully rotated and updated after the previous credentials were exposed in the browser bundle.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Local Environment Update ✅
- Updated `.env` file with new AWS credentials
- Maintained backend-only configuration (no VITE_ prefix)
- Preserved database credentials for backward compatibility

### 2. GitHub Secrets Update ✅
Updated repository secrets for CI/CD deployment:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION`
- `AWS_BUCKET_NAME`

Repository: `viakisun/craneeyes_firmware_manager`

### 3. Connectivity Testing ✅
Verified S3 access with new credentials:
- S3 ListObjects: SUCCESS
- Sample files accessible
- All operations functional

### 4. Services Restart ✅
All services successfully restarted with new credentials:
- ✅ API Server (port 3001)
- ✅ SFTP Server (port 2222)
- ✅ Vite Dev Server (port 5173)

### 5. Security Verification ✅
Comprehensive security checks performed:
- ✅ `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ No AWS keys found in `dist/` folder
- ✅ API Server health check passed
- ✅ SFTP Server accessible and functioning
- ✅ S3 file listing working through SFTP

---

## Credential Storage

**Secure Locations:**
1. Local `.env` file (gitignored)
2. GitHub Actions Secrets (encrypted)
3. Production EC2 `.env` (deployed via CI/CD)

**⚠️ NEVER store credentials in:**
- Source code files
- Documentation files
- Git repository
- Browser-accessible locations

---

## Old Credentials Status

**Action Required:** Old AWS credentials must be deactivated in AWS IAM Console to prevent unauthorized access.

---

## Security Architecture

```
✅ SECURE DESIGN:
[Browser] → [Express API + AWS Keys] → [S3]
```

**Key Principles:**
- AWS credentials only accessible server-side
- No credentials in browser bundle
- Backend API proxy for all S3 operations
- Role-based access control for SFTP users

---

## Testing Results

### API Server
- Status: ONLINE
- Health Check: PASSED

### SFTP Server
- Status: ONLINE
- Connection: SUCCESS
- File Listing: OPERATIONAL

### S3 Operations
- ✅ List objects
- ✅ Read files (via presigned URLs)
- ✅ Upload files (via backend API)
- ✅ Delete files (via backend API)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required)
1. ✅ Update local `.env` - DONE
2. ✅ Update GitHub Secrets - DONE
3. ✅ Test connectivity - DONE
4. ✅ Restart services - DONE
5. ⏳ **Deactivate old AWS credentials in IAM Console**

### For Production Deployment
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Monitor deployment logs
3. Verify EC2 services restart successfully
4. Test production SFTP and web app

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test S3 access via API
curl http://localhost:3001/api/s3/list?prefix=firmwares/

# Test SFTP (use configured user credentials)
sftp -P 2222 user@localhost

# Check GitHub Secrets
gh secret list -R viakisun/craneeyes_firmware_manager
```

**Updated by:** AI Assistant  
**Status:** ✅ Credentials secured and operational

**Security Note:** All sensitive credential values have been removed from this documentation. Actual credentials are stored securely in `.env` (local) and GitHub Secrets (CI/CD).
