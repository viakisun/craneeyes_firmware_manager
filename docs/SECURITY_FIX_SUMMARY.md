# üîí Security Fix Summary

## Critical Security Issue (RESOLVED)

**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## Problem

AWS credentials (Access Key & Secret Key) were **exposed in the browser bundle** due to incorrect architecture.

### What was exposed:

```javascript
// dist/assets/index-*.js (OLD - INSECURE)
credentials: {
  accessKeyId: "[REDACTED]",  // ‚Üê Was visible to anyone!
  secretAccessKey: "[REDACTED]"  // ‚Üê Was visible to anyone!
}
```

### Why it happened:

1. **Direct S3 access from browser**: Frontend used AWS SDK directly
2. **VITE_ prefix misuse**: Environment variables with `VITE_` prefix are bundled into JavaScript
3. **No backend proxy**: Credentials were required client-side

---

## Solution

Implemented **Backend API Proxy Pattern** to keep AWS credentials server-side only.

### Architecture Change:

```
‚ùå BEFORE (INSECURE):
[Browser + AWS Keys] ‚Üí [S3]

‚úÖ AFTER (SECURE):
[Browser] ‚Üí [Express API + AWS Keys] ‚Üí [S3]
```

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend (server.js)

Added secure S3 proxy endpoints:

- `POST /api/s3/upload` - Upload files to S3
- `GET /api/s3/download-url` - Get presigned download URL
- `DELETE /api/s3/delete` - Delete single file
- `GET /api/s3/list` - List files/folders
- `POST /api/s3/delete-multiple` - Delete multiple files

**Security:** AWS credentials only accessible to Node.js server process.

### 2. Frontend (src/services/s3.service.ts)

Completely rewrote to use backend API:

- ‚ùå Removed: AWS SDK direct usage
- ‚úÖ Added: Fetch-based API calls to backend
- ‚úÖ Zero AWS credentials in browser

### 3. Environment Variables (.env)

```diff
- VITE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...     # Exposed to browser!
- VITE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...    # Exposed to browser!
+ AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...         # Server-only
+ AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...         # Server-only
```

**Rule:** Never use `VITE_` prefix for secrets!

### 4. Build Output (dist/)

- ‚úÖ Deleted old `dist/` folder with exposed keys
- ‚úÖ Rebuilt with secure backend proxy
- ‚úÖ Verified: No AWS keys in bundle

---

## Verification

### Security Checks Performed:

```bash
# ‚úÖ No AWS Access Keys found
grep -r "AKIA[A-Z0-9]\{16\}" dist/

# ‚úÖ No AWS credential references found
grep -ri "AWS_ACCESS_KEY\|AWS_SECRET\|VITE_AWS" dist/
```

**Result:** üéâ **All checks passed!**

---

## Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:

- Keep AWS credentials in **backend-only** environment variables
- Use **API proxies** for cloud service access
- Use **presigned URLs** for temporary file access
- Regularly **scan build output** for leaked secrets

### ‚ùå DON'T:

- Use `VITE_` prefix for secrets (they get bundled!)
- Access cloud services directly from browser
- Commit `.env` files to Git
- Expose API keys in client-side code

---

## Related Files

- `server.js` - S3 proxy endpoints
- `src/services/s3.service.ts` - Frontend API client
- `.env` - Secure environment variables
- `env.example` - Template with security notes
- `.gitignore` - Ensures `.env` is never committed

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:

1. ‚úÖ Rotate AWS credentials (invalidate old keys)
2. ‚úÖ Deploy updated code to production
3. ‚úÖ Monitor AWS usage for anomalies

### Long-term:

1. üìù Add pre-commit hook to scan for secrets
2. ü§ñ Use GitHub Secret Scanning
3. üîê Implement AWS IAM least-privilege policies
